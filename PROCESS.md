# External processes and streaming data

Whenever you run an external process, there are four ways\* to interact with it post-creation:

* Write to its standard input
* Read from its standard output
* Read from its standard error
* Check its exit code

The standard `System.Process` module provides means for all of these
interactions. However, there are some downsides with using them:

* Many of the function in System.Process rely on lazy I/O.
* There is a subtle race condition when checking for exit codes.
* Dealing with `Handle`s directly is relatively low-level.

[Data.Conduit.Process](https://www.stackage.org/haddock/lts-7.3/conduit-extra-1.1.13.3/Data-Conduit-Process.html)
provides a higher-level interface for these four interactions, based
on conduit. It additionally leverages type classes to provide more
static type safety than dealing directly with System.Process, as will
be described below. The library is also designed to work with the
wonderful [async library](https://haskell-lang.org/library/async),
providing for easy, high-quality concurrency.

Some important headlines before we begin:

* Providing general parameters for creating a process, such as its
  working directory or modified environment variables, are not
  addressed by this module; you should instead use the standard
  facilities from System.Process.
* When using this module, you should generally use the multithreaded
  runtime (`-threaded`). The underlying `waitForProcess` function will
  block all threads on the singlethreaded runtime, which can be
  problematic.

\* When I said there are four ways to interact, that refers to the
primary System.Process API. See the section below on pipes and signals
for more information.

## Synopsis

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-6.19 --install-ghc runghc --package conduit-extra
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Control.Applicative      ((*>))
import           Control.Concurrent.Async (Concurrently (..))
import           Data.Conduit             (await, yield, (.|), runConduit)
import qualified Data.Conduit.Binary      as CB
import qualified Data.Conduit.List        as CL
import           Data.Conduit.Process     (ClosedStream (..), streamingProcess,
                                           proc, waitForStreamingProcess)
import           System.IO                (stdin)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Enter lines of data. I'll base64-encode it."
    putStrLn "Enter \"quit\" to exit."

    ((toProcess, close), fromProcess, ClosedStream, cph) <-
        streamingProcess (proc "base64" [])

    let input = runConduit
              $ CB.sourceHandle stdin
             .| CB.lines
             .| inputLoop
             .| toProcess

        inputLoop = do
            mbs <- await
            case mbs of
                Nothing -> close
                Just "quit" -> close
                Just bs -> do
                    yield bs
                    inputLoop

        output = runConduit $ fromProcess .| CL.mapM_
            (\bs -> putStrLn $ "from process: " ++ show bs)

    ec <- runConcurrently $
        Concurrently input *>
        Concurrently output *>
        Concurrently (waitForStreamingProcess cph)

    putStrLn $ "Process exit code: " ++ show ec
```

## Exit codes

There's a
[well documented corner case](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/9292)
in `waitForProcess` whereby multiple calls can end up in a race
condition, and therefore a deadlock. Data.Conduit.Process works around
this issue by not providing direct access to a
`ProcessHandle`. Instead, it wraps this with a
`StreamingProcessHandle`, which uses an STM TMVar under the
surface. This allows you to either poll to check if a process has
exited, or block and wait for the process to exit. As a minimal
example (ignore the streaming bits for now, they'll be explained
shortly):

```haskell
import Data.Conduit.Process

main :: IO ()
main = do
    (Inherited, Inherited, Inherited, sph) <-
        streamingProcess (shell "sleep 2")

    -- non-blocking
    getStreamingProcessExitCode sph >>= print

    -- blocking
    waitForStreamingProcess sph >>= print
```

If you need direct access to the ProcessHandle (e.g., to terminate a
process), you can use `streamingProcessHandleRaw`.

## Streaming

Now to the main event: streaming data. There are multiple ways you can
interact with streams with an external process:

* Let the child process inherit the stream from the parent process
* Provide a pre-existing `Handle`.
* Create a new `Handle` to allow more control of the interaction.

One downside of the System.Process API is that there is no static type
safety to ensure that the `std_out` parameter in fact matches up with
the value produced by `createProcess` for the standard output
handle. To overcome this, Data.Conduit.Process makes use of type
classes to represent the different ways to create a stream. This isn't
entirely intuitive from the Haddocks, but once you see the concept
used, it's easy to use yourself.

### Inherited and ClosedStream

Let's start with an example of using the simplest instances of our
typeclasses. `Inherited` says to inherit the `Handle` from the parent
process, while `ClosedStream` says to close the stream to the child
process. For example, the next snippet will inherit stdin and stdout
from the parent process and close standard error.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-6.19 --install-ghc runghc --package conduit-extra
import Data.Conduit.Process

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Just wrapping cat. Use Ctrl-D to exit."

    (Inherited, Inherited, ClosedStream, cph) <-
        streamingProcess (shell "cat")

    waitForStreamingProcess cph >>= print
```

Note that there's no way to send an EOF in School of Haskell, so the
above active code will never terminate.

### Conduit

It would be pretty strange to have a library in conduit-extra that
didn't provide some conduit capabilities. You can additionally get a
`Sink` to be used to feed data into the process via standard input,
and `Source`s for consuming standard output and error.

This next example reads standard input from the console, processes
standard output with a conduit, and closes standard error.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-6.19 --install-ghc runghc --package conduit-extra
import           Data.Conduit         (runConduit, (.|))
import qualified Data.Conduit.List    as CL
import           Data.Conduit.Process

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Just wrapping cat. Use Ctrl-D to exit."

    (Inherited, src, ClosedStream, cph) <-
        streamingProcess (shell "cat")

    runConduit $ src .| CL.mapM_ print

    waitForStreamingProcess cph >>= print
```

Note that these `Source`s and `Sink`s will *never* close their
`Handle`s. This is done on purpose, to allow them to be used multiple
times without accidentally closing their streams. In many cases,
you'll need to close the streams manually, which brings us to our next
section.

### Conduit + close

Let's say we'd like to close our input stream whenever the user types
in "quit". To do that, we need to get an action to close the standard
input `Handle`. This is simple: instead of just returning a `Source`
or `Sink`, we ask for a tuple of a `Source`/`Sink` together with an
`IO ()` action to close the handle.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-6.19 --install-ghc runghc --package conduit-extra
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Data.ByteString      (ByteString)
import           Data.Conduit         (Source, await, yield, runConduit, (.|))
import qualified Data.Conduit.Binary  as CB
import           Data.Conduit.Process
import           System.IO            (stdin)

userInput :: Source IO ByteString
userInput =
       CB.sourceHandle stdin
    .| CB.lines
    .| loop
  where
    loop = do
        mbs <- await
        case mbs of
            Nothing -> return ()
            Just "quit" -> return ()
            Just bs -> do
                yield bs
                yield "\n"
                loop

main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn "Just wrapping cat. Type \"quit\" to exit."

    ((sink, close), Inherited, ClosedStream, cph) <-
        streamingProcess (shell "cat")

    runConduit $ userInput .| sink
    close

    waitForStreamingProcess cph >>= print
```

### UseProvidedHandle

Let's take a quick detour from our running example to talk about the
last special type: `UseProvidedHandle`. This says to
`streamingProcess`: use the example value of `UseHandle` provided in
`std_in`/`std_out`/`std_err`. We can use this to redirect output
directly to a file:

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-6.19 --install-ghc runghc --package conduit-extra
import Data.Conduit.Process
import System.IO (withFile, IOMode (..))

main :: IO ()
main = do
    let fp = "date.txt"
    withFile fp WriteMode $ \h -> do
        (ClosedStream, UseProvidedHandle, ClosedStream, cph) <-
            streamingProcess (shell "date")
                { std_out = UseHandle h
                }
        waitForStreamingProcess cph >>= print
    readFile fp >>= print
```

Note that this type breaks the type safety a bit, as it requires
synchronization between the values provided in the `CreateProcess`
value and the return type. This was a conscious trade-off to keep the
Data.Conduit.Process API as close as possible to System.Process.

## Use with async

In our examples above, we only ever used a single `Source` or `Sink`
at a time. There's a good reason for this: we can easily run into
deadlocks if we don't properly handle concurrency. There are multiple
ways to do this, but I'm going to strongly recommend using the async
package, which handles many corner cases automatically. In particular,
the `Concurrently` data type and its `Applicative` instance make it
easy and safe to handle multiple streams at once.

Instead of duplicating it here, I'll ask the reader to please refer
back to the synopsis example, which ties this all together with two
threads for handling streams, and another thread which blocks waiting
for the process to exit. That style of concurrency is very idiomatic
usage of this library.

## Pipes and signals

When we listed four ways of interacting with a process, that wasn't
completely accurate. There are of course many other ways to interact
with a process, both directly and indirectly. For example:

* Write to a file that the process will read.
* Open a TCP socket to talk to the process.
* Use up all memory on the system so that the process can't allocate
  memory.

But there are in particular two ways of interacting with a child
process that are very common on POSIX systems: sending signals (such
as termination), and connecting over a pipe. The example below
demonstrates these two methods, together with the previously mentioned
four.

```haskell
#!/usr/bin/env stack
-- stack --resolver lts-6.19 --install-ghc runghc --package conduit-extra
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import           Control.Concurrent       (threadDelay)
import           Control.Concurrent.Async (Concurrently (..))
import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8    as S8
import           Data.Conduit             (yield, runConduit, (.|))
import           Data.Conduit.Binary      (sourceHandle)
import qualified Data.Conduit.List        as CL
import           Data.Conduit.Process     (streamingProcess, proc, terminateProcess, streamingProcessHandleRaw, waitForStreamingProcess)
import           System.Posix.IO          (closeFd, fdToHandle, createPipe)

main :: IO ()
main = do
    (reader, writer) <- createPipe

    writeFile "script.sh" $ unlines
        [ "trap 'echo Got TERM; exit 42' TERM"
        , "echo Sending to standard output"
        , "echo Sending to standard error >&2"
        , "echo Sending to our pipe >&" ++ show writer
        , "cat # Print everything from stdin to stdout"
        , "while true; do sleep 1; done"
        ]

    readerH <- fdToHandle reader

    ((input, close), out, err, cph)
        <- streamingProcess (proc "bash" ["script.sh"])

    closeFd writer

    let go src name =
            Concurrently $ runConduit $ src
            .| CL.mapM_ (\bs -> S8.putStr $ S8.pack $ name ++ ": " ++ show bs ++ "\n")
        feed = Concurrently $ do
            threadDelay 1000000
            runConduit
                $ yield "Feeding standard input, then terminating"
               .| input
            terminateProcess $ streamingProcessHandleRaw cph
            close

    runConcurrently
         $ go out "stdout"
        *> go err "stderr"
        *> go (sourceHandle readerH) "pipe"
        *> feed
        *> Concurrently (waitForStreamingProcess cph >>= print)
```

Don't be too worried if some of the details here- especially the shell
script- are unfamiliar. This is just meant to demonstrate that
Data.Conduit.Process does not get in the way of any standard process
interaction.
